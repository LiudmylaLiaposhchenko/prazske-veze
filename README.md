The project "Get to know Prague towers" is a website that gives information about towers and viewpoints in Prague, helps to plan your trip and learn about Czech history and architecture. 
For tourists and inhabitants of Prague.

This is my final project in Czechitas Digital Academy:Web. My task was:
- come up with the idea;
- create a design;
- make a prototype in Figma;
- development in React.js;
- deployment.

I learned to create pages using both vanilla CSS (homepage) and Material UI (tower page).
